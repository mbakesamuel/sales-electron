## Pre-training checklist (trainer)

1. Training PC with app installed; **ADMIN** + sample roles seeded.
2. Open financial year + **current month**.
3. Sample data: 2 sales points, sellable storage, Cash + cheque methods, LPO + bottled products, unit prices, 3+ customers (mixed types), 1 validated DO with balance.
4. Printed quick-reference: open-month rule, validation queues, report as-at rule.
5. Export user guide and this schedule for handouts: `npm run docs:export`.

## Assessment (light)

- **Day 1 quiz:** What blocks posting? What do customer types affect?
- **Day 2 lab sign-off:** Clerk creates pending sale; supervisor validates; stock visible on On hand.
- **Day 3 lab sign-off:** Print daily sales + commitment report; explain one troubleshooting scenario.
