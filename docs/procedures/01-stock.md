### P-ST-01 Opening Stock balances

**Path:** Stock → Opening Stock balances  
**Who:** Statistics clerk (submits **draft**); supervisor / manager with **Validate stock documents** (posts immediately when they enter data themselves)  
**Before you start:** Financial month is open; collection point exists; storage locations are assigned under **General Parameters → Locations Assignment** (except Palm Kernel / Cake products, which need no location)

1. Open **Stock → Opening Stock balances**.
2. Click **New Entry**.
3. Select the **Collection point**.
4. Set the **Date** (must be inside the open financial month). That date becomes the movement date on reports.
5. Click **Add line** for each product:
   - Choose **Product**.
   - Choose **Storage location** (shows **—** for Palm Kernel / Cake — leave as is).
   - Enter the **desired on-hand** quantity (what the balance should be after this opening entry).
6. Repeat **Add line** until all products for that point are entered.
7. Click **Save** (button may show **Saving…** while busy).
8. Read the success message:
   - Clerks without validate rights: lines go to **Awaiting validation** — balances do **not** change yet.
   - Users with validate rights: balances post immediately.

**Check:**

- Draft path: table **Awaiting validation** lists your collection point / products.
- Posted path: balances appear in the posted balances table; **Stock → Stock → On hand** shows the new quantities after refresh.

**If it fails:**

- Closed month or date outside open month.
- Missing storage location on a product that requires one.
- Location mixing rules (bulk products cannot share a tank; bottled and bulk cannot share) — clear conflicting stock first.
- Ask a supervisor to run **P-ST-09** if your lines stay in **Awaiting validation**.

### P-ST-02 Stock hub — On hand and Movements

**Path:** Stock → Stock  
**Who:** Anyone with Stock route access  
**Before you start:** None beyond login

1. Open **Stock → Stock**.
2. If you see **Loose / Bottled / All**, use the filter to narrow the product set (unified Stock writers only).
3. Open the **On hand** tab — live balances by product and location.
4. Open the **Movements** tab — ledger of quantity changes; use filters (product, location) as needed.

**Check:** On hand matches what you expect after recent receipts, sales, and transfers. Movements show dated rows for those events.

**If it fails:** Wrong collection-point scope (user assigned to one point); wrong Loose/Bottled filter; looking at report as-at vs live On hand (they can differ).

8. If saved as draft, a supervisor completes **P-ST-09**.

**Check:** Receipt appears as **POSTED** (or **DRAFT**). **On hand** increases after post.

2. Click **New transfer** (wording may be **New** / create).

5. Add lines: product, qty, from location (and to location for within-point moves as the form requires).
