### P-SA-01 Document booklets — issue a range

**Path:** Sales → Document booklets  
**Who:** Users with write on document-booklets (often admin / supervisor)  
**Before you start:** Collection points exist; you know the paper booklet from–to serials

1. Open **Sales → Document booklets**.
2. Start **Issue booklet** (or equivalent new/issue action).
3. Choose kind: **Sales invoice** or **Delivery order**.
4. Select the **collection point** that will use the booklet.
5. Enter booklet code (if required), **start serial**, and **end serial** (digits).
6. Optional notes.
7. If you have validate rights, you may activate immediately; otherwise leave pending for **P-SA-02**.
8. Confirm issue.

**Check:** Booklet appears in the list as **PENDING** or **ACTIVE**. Active ranges can be used when App settings enforce booklet validation.

**If it fails:** Overlapping serial ranges; invalid from–to; wrong collection point.

### P-SA-02 Booklet validation

**Path:** Sales → Booklet validation (or validate from Document booklets when allowed)  
**Who:** Supervisor with `validate_document_booklets`  
**Before you start:** Pending booklet issuances exist

1. Open **Sales → Booklet validation**.
2. Review pending booklets (kind, point, serial range).
3. **Validate** approved issuances (status → **ACTIVE**).
4. Reject per site process if the UI offers it.

**Check:** Booklet status **ACTIVE**; clerks can enter serials from that range on invoices/DOs when enforcement is on.

**If it fails:** Action or route missing; booklet already cancelled.

### P-SA-03 Invoicing — normal loose sale with Pick DO

**Path:** Sales → Invoicing → **New invoice** (modal)  
**Who:** Sales clerk with write on sales  
**Before you start:** Open month; validated DO with remaining kg (**P-DO-04**); available stock as of invoice date (on-hand minus other pending invoices); booklet serial or auto-generate on; non-cash payment method configured

1. Open **Sales → Invoicing** (invoice list).
2. Click **New invoice**. In the modal, enter **Booklet serial no.** unless auto-generate invoice numbers is on.
3. Tick **Registered customer** and select the customer; select **collection point**.
4. Set disposition to **normal** (default commercial sale).
5. Set invoice **date** in the open month; enter **vehicle number** when required.
6. Click **Pick DO**:
   - List is filtered to that customer + collection point, validated DOs with remaining kg (CF rows marked **CF**).
   - Click a **product** row — DO links, Add line opens with product / remaining qty / DO price.
7. Confirm storage location (sales tank when App settings require it for LPO) and save the line.
8. Add further lines as needed (Pick DO / Add line).
9. Confirm payment method (cheque / traite / bank transfer — **Cash is hidden** on loose) and locked amount = invoice total. Complete traite/cheque fields if shown.
10. **Save as pending** (or **Validate invoice** if you have direct validate).

**Check:** Invoice saved; appears on **Invoice list** for the open month; its qty soft-reserves available stock for other new invoices. After validation (**P-SA-06**), stock deducts and DO remaining drops on **P-DO-06**.

**If it fails:** Pick DO empty — DO not validated, wrong customer/point, or zero remaining; insufficient available stock as of invoice date (including qty held by other pending invoices); serial duplicate / not in active booklet; payment total mismatch.
